I am currently a final-year PhD student in Computer Science and Technology at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), advised by Prof. [Jiahai Wang](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2551). Previously, I was a visiting PhD student in Industrial Systems Engineering and Management at National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by Prof. [Hanzhang Qin](https://hanzhangqin.com/). I received my master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Guangdong University of Technology (GDUT), advised by Prof. [Qingxin Chen](https://jdgcxy.gdut.edu.cn/info/1099/2000.htm), and I completed my bachelor’s degree in Industrial Engineering at GDUT. Additionally, I currently collaborate closely with Prof. [Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io/) from Singapore Management University (SMU).

Research Interests
======
My interests focus on Learning to Optimize (L2Opt), especially Neural Combinatorial Optimization, where I exploit Deep (Reinforcement) Learning (including Large Language Model) to solve Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs) such as the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). This area lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research, making it both fascinating and challenging. My research in L2Opt includes multi-objective COPs (MOCOPs), complex COPs, out-of-distribution generalization, etc.
